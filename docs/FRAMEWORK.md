# Ratio Documentation

## Introduction

### What is Ratio?
This section should provide a high-level overview of Ratio as an AWS-based Agent Operating System. Explain its core purpose, the problem it solves, and its primary value proposition. Include a brief history of the project and its design philosophy.

### Key Features
List and briefly describe the main capabilities of Ratio:
- **Hierarchical File System**: Describe how Ratio provides a Unix-like filesystem with permissions, how it's backed by S3, and its core advantages
- **Version Control**: Explain the built-in file versioning capabilities and how they help track changes
- **Entity Authentication**: Outline the security model based on entities and groups
- **Agent Execution**: Describe the agent framework for defining and running autonomous agents

### Getting Started
- **System Requirements**: List hardware, software, and AWS requirements for running Ratio
- **Installation Guide**: Step-by-step instructions for deploying Ratio to AWS
- **Quick Start Example**: A minimal working example showing how to initialize the system, create entities, and run a simple agent
