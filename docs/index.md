# Ratio Documentation

## What is Ratio?

Ratio is an AWS-based Agent Operating System that provides a secure environment for autonomous agents to execute tasks. Built on AWS infrastructure, Ratio combines a robust file system with entity-based authentication and an agent execution framework to create a powerful platform for building agent-based applications.

At its core, Ratio provides:

- **Hierarchical File System** with Unix-like permissions, versioning, and lineage tracking
- **Entity-based Authentication** with groups and role-based access control
- **Agent Framework** for defining and executing autonomous agents
- **Event-driven Architecture** allowing agents to respond to system events

Ratio was designed for scenarios where secure, auditable, agent-based processing is required, such as content workflows, data processing pipelines, and autonomous decision-making systems.
